<p><font color=grey style="font-family:verdana">My first released single, Love Across The Universe, "an experimental House Music track that starts with a guitar intro that builds into an energic synth based experience" as I described it on Soundcloud, was made somewhere in February 2023 and then the part that took me the most time was the cover art, lol</font></p>
