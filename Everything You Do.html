    <p><font color=grey style="font-family:verdana">My second released single, "Everything You Do" started as a challange with some friends, as we had to do a compliation album but nobody was really available, only me and the one who came with the idea. They said that we can make a song in any genre but it literally had something about a slumber party in the name so yeah, probably ambient would've been the best genre. Anyway, this song started as a song ment for that thing but it eventually became more and more electronic to the point that I changed my goals. Now I just wanted to replicate my style from the beginning of 2023, aka the "Love Across The Universe" style so I did exactly that. Also, the cover art is made in Blender, being my first render ever on my own and I think it came out pretty good considering that fact. It may seem a bit repetitive but it is kinda intentional to set a specific vibe. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it! </font></p>
