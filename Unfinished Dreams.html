    <p><font color=grey style="font-family:verdana">Unfinished Dreams is an EP that wasn't really meant to exist in the first place... What do I mean by that? Well, first there was only one song that is now known as "A Light" that I wanted to release as a single with a completely different cover art and shortly after I made a song that completely changed my way of making music and layering instruments, "Unfinished Dreams". It was kind of a new workflow entirely and this one was also meant to be its own single. Probably in an alternate timeline this is exactly what happened but in this one thanks to my "very good" music distributor that takes more than two weeks to approve a release I was something like "How in the world do I release two singles one after another so fast?!" Then the realisation that I could combine them into one release came to my mind so that's exactly what I did. But wait, what about the other songs? "No Turning Back" started as an experimental project heavely inspired from my friend's EP, "Alaska"(honestly, go check it out, you won't regret it: <a href="https://xerwinxpl.bandcamp.com/album/alaska">https://xerwinxpl.bandcamp.com/album/alaska</a> ) Anyway, he said that he only used Vital, a very powerful synth in which you can pretty much design any sound you want (if you know how to lol) so I challanged myself to also use Vital to create a new sound/instrument so yeah. "Everything Has An End" was made as an album closer and it was the third iteration (yes there are two b-sides but they aren't that good). There is also a bonus track for those who choose to download the album from Bandcamp that is pretty much inspired from a dark ambient track that used vocals as a background instrument and I liked that so much that I also did it myself. I hope it came out pretty well for a track that isn't technically in the album yet it is.<br><br>Huh, you are still curious about the B-sides and the og cover art for "A Light"?, well click here for that: <a href="Unfinished Dreams B-Sides.html">Unfinished Dreams B-Sides</a> </font></p>
